Slug: roster

A class roster, to be filled out by the students.

Jen DiZio, 3rd year PhD student (and admittedly a non-programmer); I am hoping (or, HOPING) I can contribute to a new platform we're launching as a collaboration between UCB and the University of Tromso, the Collabosphere (https://collabosphere.berkeley.edu). At the very least, I am going to monitor the interactions between our students and the Norwegian group.
